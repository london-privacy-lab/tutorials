### Yubikey on Arch Linux

https://github.com/london-privacy-lab/tutorials/blob/master/yubikey-arch-linux.md

Yubikey is a physical FIDO Alliance U2F Two-Factor Authentication device. You simply plug into your USB port, USB-C, or even NFC, to get an additional layer of security. I've been putting off getting it setup as it looked more complex than I'd originally thought. Ultimately, it was easy once I had all the information I needed.

To help you out I've thrown it all together in one post. Please share the advice if you find it useful to you.
